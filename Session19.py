# We need to find frequency of occurrence of word institution in above 5 reviews

# 1. Put the data in an effective data structures
#    > HashTable | Capacity -> number of Words in number of Reviews

# 3. Implementation of OOPS with Data Structures is preferable :)
#    > Word : word, frequency, alphabets
